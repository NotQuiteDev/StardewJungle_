  - 'Welcome, child of the earth. This is the Altar of Colors, the heart of our Harvest
    Festival. '
  - "The festival is more than song and dance\u2014it is our vow to the land. "
  - Each year, we return what it has given us, in colors as radiant as the seasons
    themselves.
  - "The altar has grown silent. To reawaken it, we must offer the purest essences\u2014gold-quality
    crops, each color carrying a blessing of its own. "
  - From the vigor of Red to the mystery of Purple, only when all hues are gathered
    will the land spirit bless us once more.
  - So I must ask you, will you help us complete this prayer to the land?
